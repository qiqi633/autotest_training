pytest-fixtures
===============

Common fixtures for pytest

To use, just install it and pytest will automatically detect and load all fixtures::

    pip install pytest-fixtures

I suggest adding it to your test requirements in `tox.ini` or `setup.py`.

No Dependencies
---------------

This package does not depend on any other packages and never will. It uses standard libraries or uses run-time
imports and therefore it is lightweight to add to any project. As for which external run-time dependency a fixture
needs, that is documented here and shouldn't matter as you would only use the fixtures that your project already has
dependencies on.

Click Fixtures
--------------

Fixtures for Click <http://click.pocoo.org/>

.. code-block:: python

    def test_cli(cli_runner):
        result = cli_runner.invoke( ... )                       # Prints out stdout/stderr from result with headings
        result = cli_runner.invoke_and_assert_exit(0, ... )     # Same as above and asserts exit code == 0
